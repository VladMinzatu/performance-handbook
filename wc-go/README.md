# wc-go

This is a simplified version of the standard Unix command-line utility [wc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html). It doesn't support all the flags and arguments. In fact, it will always just print out the number of lines, number of words, and number of characters in the input. The input can be a file, or stdin in case no file path is provided as an argument.

Instead, though, it does support some other arguments (the `-p` flag), which indicate strategies for how we will process the input. (for our tests)
