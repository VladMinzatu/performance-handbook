# Cost and capacity

While shown as a separate category from core business SLIs here, infrastructure capacity and cost are absolutely crucial to businesses. And the line is bluryr, this is not so much a separate category, as a more subtle signal, but one that should be considered for application and business SLO definitions:

Examples:

- Unused slack capacity in cloud services or k8s resources is wasted money
- GPUs can be very expensive and their goodput should be optimised
