# Tools overview

This is a high level overview of the tools that can be used for performance analysis (observability benchmarking and profiling) on Linux. It's meant to be a starting point, the 20,000-foot view of the landscape. It is unlikely that that I will evolve this to go into much more detail. That's what Brendan Gregg's excellent book [BPF Performance Tools](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780136554820) is for.

Here, I cover the following topics:

- [High Level Linux Tools](01_high_level_linux_tools.md)
- [Linux tracing and performance infrastructure](02_linux_perf_infrastructure.md)
- [Low-Level Tracing and Profiling Tools](03_perf_tracing_and_profiling.md)
- [Dynamic Tracing & eBPF-based Tools](04_dynamic_tracing_and_profiling_with_eBPF.md)
- [Syscall Tracing & Runtime Security Tools](04_syscall_tracing_and_runtime_security.md)
- [Go Tools for profiling and observability](05_go_profiling_and_observability.md)
