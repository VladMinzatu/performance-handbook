# Low-Level Tracing and Profiling Tools

These tools provide fine-grained details about system behavior â€” from CPU cycles and function calls to system calls and library usage. They're essential for debugging performance issues, understanding application behavior, and profiling workloads.

## perf

Performance analysis and CPU profiling tool.

Key Features:
- Records CPU performance counters, software events, hardware events, etc.
- Supports sampling and tracing (e.g., perf top, perf record).
- Can profile kernel and user-space code.

Use Case: Identify CPU hotspots and performance bottlenecks in code.

Example Usage:
```
perf top
perf record ./your_app
perf report
```

## strace

Trace system calls and signals of a process.

Key Features:
- Intercepts and logs all syscalls made by a process.
- Great for debugging unexpected behavior or I/O issues.
- Supports attaching to running processes.

Use Case: Understand what syscalls a process makes and in what order.

Example Usage:
```
strace ./your_app
strace -p <pid>
```

## ltrace

Trace library calls and signals of a process.

Key Features:
- Intercepts and logs dynamic library calls (like malloc, printf).
- Complements strace by showing higher-level library interactions.

Use Case: See which shared library functions are being used by a process.

Example Usage:
```
ltrace ./your_app
```

## ftrace

Built-in Linux kernel tracer for debugging and profiling.

Key Features:
- Can trace function calls, interrupts, scheduling, and more.
- Very low overhead.
- Accessible via /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/.
- Underpins many other tracing tools.

Use Case: Kernel-level performance tracing and debugging.

Example Usage:
```
echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
```

## Notes
- `perf` and `ftrace` are powerful but can require elevated permissions.
- `strace` and `ltrace` are great for user-space debugging but introduce some overhead.
- All tools are part of most major distributions, though you may need to install them (e.g., via apt, yum, or dnf).
