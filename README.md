# performance-handbook

In this repo I am writing collection of small projects (mainly centered around system programming topics) and then doing performance and behaviour analysis on them while testing them in different conditions.

I will mainly be using Linux performance and debugging tools, eBPF tools like bpftrace and Go perf tools. And then I will document findings and comments. I'm running the tests on my Mac and, when necessary, in a Linux VM.

The individual projects will be in subdirectories starting from here, and each will have its own README describing the project and test outcomes. For example:
- [wc-go](./wc-go)
