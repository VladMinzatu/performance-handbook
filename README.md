# performance-handbook

Planning to develop a neatly organized personal handbook for performance observability and optimization, with examples. Primarily motivated by my interest in concurrency and asynchronous patterns, which I want to explore in multiple languages.

Unless otherwise specified or furhter clarified, we're talking about **Linux** here, as the OS.

Structure to emerge over time... Let's see how it goes.
